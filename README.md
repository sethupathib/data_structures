Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

**I'm yet to implement the following. Will do it very soon.**
1. Priority Queue
2. Hash Table
3. Heaps
4. Trees and Advanced Trees
5. Graphs
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Dynamic Programming 
8. Sorting and Searching (already done, but will do it in a systematic manner again)



**Problems that are hard for me**

1. Replace 'Pi'.
2. 



**Revision (Must)** 

Revise from Apni Kaksha
1. Quick Sort
2. Merge Sort (Not so much, but still)
3. All recursion problems. (N Queen (isSafe function), Sudoku Solver)
4. Binary Search Problems (Book Allocation, Aggressive Cows etc)
5. Dynamic Programming Problems (Coin Change)
