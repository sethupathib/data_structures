**Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation**

**Topics**
1. Priority Queue
2. Hash Table
3. Heaps
4. Trees and Advanced Trees
5. Graphs
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Dynamic Programming 
8. Sorting and Searching (already done, but will do it in a systematic manner again)



**Problems that are hard for me**

1. Replace 'Pi'.
2. Holiday Accomodation.



**Revision (Must)** 

Revise from Apni Kaksha
1. Quick Sort
2. Merge Sort (Not so much, but still)
3. All recursion problems. (N Queen (isSafe function), Sudoku Solver)
4. Binary Search Problems (Book Allocation, Aggressive Cows etc)
5. Dynamic Programming Problems (Coin Change)
6. BackTracking (Rat in a Maze, N Queen, Sudoku, Knights Tour)
7. TSP
8. SSSP
9. STL revision.
10. Greedy Problems.
11. BFS Problem (Snake and Ladders). I'll have to revisit later.


**Data-Structures that I enjoyed the most**
1. Segment Trees.
2. Segment Trees with Lazy Propagation.
3. Graph BFS/DFS.
4. BST Implementation.


**Expected Areas of Work**
1. Floorplanning.
2. Routing.
3. Timing Problems.
